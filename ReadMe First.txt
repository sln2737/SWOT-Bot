Please read thoroughly the associated web page before attempting to use this add-in.

Install only the version of the add-in that is appropriate for your requirements. 

Either use the EXE installer (which will remove earlier versions) or manually put the template in the Word Startup folder.

Note that the EXE installer will put the template in the default startup folder. If you have moved the location of the startup folder, change the path at the prompt to reflect the new location.
