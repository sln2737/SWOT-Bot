3,"The debt equity ratio has been low during the review period. The same stood at 0.21 times as on 31st March 2019 on the back of additional term loans and short term working capital loans undertaken from bank. The Company undertook significant capital expenditure mainly in the form of land and building, and plant and machinery in the last three years for setting up a plant to manufacture value added SS castings. The capex done so far has mainly been funded through internal accruals. Moreover, for the ongoing capex of about INR 75.00 Crore in pipeline, the Company is planning to fund the same through internal accruals and loans from banks. Given that the internal cash accruals of the Company are about INR 87 Crore in FY 2019, the same is likely to have little impact on the gearing levels of the Company.

Further, though collection period is high, it is primarily funded through extended creditor days. Moreover, the financial support from the Group is also visible in the form of infusion of funds by holding company in the form of equity and debentures during the review period. This funding has helped the Company in repaying its debt obligations and managing its working capital and capital expenditure. On the back of lower debt, Company?s interest coverage ratio remained uneven and stood adequate at 3.45 times during FY 2018. Furthermore, Company?s liquidity position improved and remained adequate with increasing cash accruals sufficient to meet its maturing debt obligations and current ratio of 1.54 times as on 31st March 2018.

Current capacity utilization at Dahej and Guwahati facilities are in the range of 15-20% and these capacities will start operating at optimal capacity from FY 2021. Negative impact is higher opex cost but at the same time it will give access to emerging markets for few drugs as it will allow direct inspection of its facilities.

A lower debt component when compared with Company?s healthy tangible networth would provide the Group financial flexibility to procure additional funds for further expansion. Further, low existing debt exposure makes the Group more attractive to lenders as there is less risk in terms of the ability of the Company to service the loan.

Also, institutional sales in Africa declined sharply (from 22% of the total revenue in FY 2017 to 9% in FY 2019). This is on account of lower volumes and offtake in institutional sales business (as Global Funds (wing of WHO) received lower donations) and hence procurements have reduced. This also impacted the margins apart from revenue pressure. Further, as informed, Company estimates margin to remain on similar lines for FY 2020 and it will improve from FY 2021.

As informed by the management, the Company faces competition from both local and international players. The electronics manufacturing industry is characterized by high cost of raw materials along with low product differentiation and requirement of additional investment based on changes in technology. Thus, efficiencies in this business are obtained from economies of the scale which spread out the fixed costs over a larger base of operations, leading to improvement in profitability.

The net margins of the Company remained low (below 1%) during the review period owing to trading nature of business with a large part of the product portfolio being commoditized in nature. Commodity chemicals or bulk chemicals are less complex than value added chemicals and generate lower profitability compared to specialty chemicals. Further, the dip in margins at gross levels despite revenue growth were primarily on account of increase of purchases cost as a percentage of revenue, indicating that the Company is not effectively been able to pass on the incremental cost to its customers, primarily on account of nature of products traded and the stiff competition.

The increase was a result of implementation of Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) in October 2012. Further, with a large number of applications pending, the pace of approvals is likely to remain high. In addition to GDUFA, USFDA has taken several steps to increase competition in the market for prescription drugs and also facilitate entry of lower-cost alternatives through Drug Competition Action Plan.ÿWhile these initiatives benefit generic players, they are also likely to increase the competition for similar set of molecules.

Private final consumption expenditure growth fell to 7.2 per cent in the fourth quarter from 8 per cent in the third and 9.7 per cent in the second. The growth stood at a meager 7.3 per cent in the first quarter. Manufacturing activity suffered a slowdown, with growth falling to 3.1 per cent in Q4 compared to 6.4 per cent in the third quarter, 6.9 per cent in the second quarter and 12.1 per cent in Q1.ÿThe economy?s revival will be a key challenge under the new government. The industry slowdown too can impact the Company?s topline and margins as witnessed in a stagnant growth in Q1 of FY 2020 over the previous year.

2476,"The Company derived on an average more than 58% of its revenues from the international markets exposing it to foreign exchange risk. However, it enjoys the advantage of natural hedge (imports stood around 81% of the total purchase) to an extent. Movements in exchange rates are influenced by various macro factors like demand/ supply of the foreign currency, domestic inflation, deterioration in the financial condition of other economies relative to USA and due to events like Brexit, etc. Most of these factors are hard to predict leading to volatility in exchange rates. While the firming up of dollar in current scenario will have a positive sway on the profitability of the Company since majority of export is to the United States of America, any adverse movements in dollar rates going ahead will have undesirable ramifications on its margins. However, the Company has earned a profit on foreign exchange transactions in all the three years which largely supported the net margin.",4,0,0,0,1

2480,"The Indian chemical industry is fairly fragmented comprising of both small scale (unorganized) and large scale (organized) companies, in addition to presence of multinational companies. As informed by the management, it faces stiff competition from various companies in both domestic and overseas market from organized as well as unorganized sector. With Indian chemical industry currently contributing only 3% to GDP, it offers huge growth opportunities fueled by rising domestic consumption. This could attract more global corporations to capitalize on the growth story, further increasing the competition. Increasing competitive intensity could restrict the ability of the Company to scale its volumes and pass on the price hike to its customers (owing to pricing pressures), thus adversely affecting its revenue and profitability.",4,0,0,0,1
